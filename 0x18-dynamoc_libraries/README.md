# Dynamic libraries

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about dynamic and shared libraries in **C language**.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc asit is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* All your files must be executable

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`libholberton.s` | Dynamic library that contains many functions
`1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` | Shell script that creates a dynamic library
`100-operations.so` | Dynamic library that contains mathematical functions
`101-make_me_win.sh` | Shell script that injects a C program in order to hack `gm` executable file
